# Implementing and Analyzing Quantum Algorithms Using Qiskit

Welcome to my departmental internship project repository focused on **Quantum Computing with Qiskit**. This 4-week internship involves implementing quantum algorithms, analyzing their classical counterparts, and comparing performance across various metrics.

## Problem Statement

> **Implement a quantum algorithm (e.g., Grover's or Shor's) using a quantum simulator (Qiskit), and compare its performance with a classical algorithm solving the same problem.**

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Qiskit**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Matplotlib & NumPy**
- **Git/GitHub**

---

## Key Learnings

- Practical understanding of qubit behavior and quantum gates
- Oracle design and amplitude amplification in Grover’s Algorithm
- Time complexity differences between quantum (`O(√N)`) and classical (`O(N)`) search
- Comparative analysis and visualization of performance data
